### Description
- What I did:

  Analyze real world log data from a game server I host in regard to time of day, game strategy and duration. Includes fancy hand-made graphs.

- Background information:

  This script can analyze files generated by the game server I run. **[The accompanying app](https://github.com/ffactory-ofcl/fourinarow-app)** has around 1700 downloads on the playstore of which 600 still have the app installed. The game is a minimal version of the classic game "Four in a Row" written in **Flutter+Dart**, with added online functionality, friends list, chat, lobby system and local (two players, one device) play. Download it here: [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ml.fourinarow) (Android only)

  ## **A Web-Version [can be found here](https://play.fourinarow.ml/)**
  It is not bug-free because the mobile version has higher priority.

  The server is written in Rust. In case you care, [please have a look here](https://github.com/ffactory-ofcl/fourinarow-server) and give it a star :)


This "project" contains:
* log analyzer with several modi
* (real world example) log file

## Run
- Open console window in fullscreen. 
- `python3 src/main.py`
- Follow the interactive prompts to explore the logs.

### Custom Configuration
Add your own logs in the given format or modify them.

## Documentation
The script interactively asks which file you would like to analyze (proposing the first .log file it finds in the script's working directory), lists the available analyzation methods. Then, the selected method is executed, displaying general (how many ...?) stats and a graph with x and y legends.

## Known Issues
None.

Much larger amounts of data might surface processing time issues but the current set of 500,000 lines only took a couple of seconds to process.
